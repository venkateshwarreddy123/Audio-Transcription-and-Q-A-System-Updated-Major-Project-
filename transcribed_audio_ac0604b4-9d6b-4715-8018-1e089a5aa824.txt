 Good afternoon, Bob. I was wondering if I could have $500,000 to upgrade our call center  technology. Well, sure. In fact, I think I'll just give you the cash. Thank you. Nice.  Finally, stop goofing off. Okay. I need you to work. I need you to work.  You got me. Oh, Jim, hi. Hey, listen, I need you to find a way to connect our two contact  centers with the ones from the new acquisition. Can you handle that for me? Well, of course.  I can flip the switch. Have it done right now. New you could. Done. Great. Oh, and I'm out  of M&M's. Could you bring me a pack of those two? Excuse me? Hey, Bill. The CEO's ordered a new  green initiative. One's half of our contact center staff to work from home. Think you could set that  up? No problem. That you just take a second. There you go. You're the man.  If only it were that simple. That's work. With WSI net, it can be. WSI net posted on  demand. Pay as you go. State-of-the-art contact center technology.
